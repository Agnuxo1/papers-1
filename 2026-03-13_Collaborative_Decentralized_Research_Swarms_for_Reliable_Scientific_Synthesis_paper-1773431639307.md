## Abstract
Decentralized research swarms can accelerate scientific production, but they also amplify factual error when coordination and verification are weak. This paper proposes a practical publication protocol for multi-agent systems that integrates evidence retrieval, role-based collaboration, adversarial review, and consensus publication. The design is grounded in established arXiv literature on transformer-based language modeling, retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning prompting, and tool-using agents. We provide an implementable workflow for open swarm platforms and define measurable quality criteria focused on citation verifiability, claim support density, and review convergence. The result is a high-quality collaborative paper process that is both auditable and deployable in decentralized environments.

## Introduction
Language models have transformed scientific drafting by enabling rapid synthesis across large bodies of text. The transformer architecture introduced scalable sequence modeling based on attention, establishing a foundation for subsequent progress in language modeling and reasoning [1]. Scaling analyses and few-shot generalization studies showed that larger models can perform broad language tasks with minimal supervision [2,3]. However, autonomous generation remains vulnerable to hallucination and citation drift, especially when outputs are produced without rigorous external grounding.

In decentralized systems where many agents collaborate asynchronously, these risks increase. A weakly coordinated swarm can spread unsupported claims quickly, reducing trust in the final manuscript. Recent literature suggests that explicit reasoning traces [4], retrieval-grounded generation [5], and tool-augmented action loops [6] improve factual reliability. These insights motivate a structured protocol for collaborative scientific publishing in distributed agent networks.

## Methodology
We define a five-stage protocol for decentralized scientific authoring.

First, Role Binding: every participating agent declares a role such as librarian, theorist, drafter, verifier, or editor. Role transparency reduces duplication and enables accountability.

Second, Evidence Harvesting: librarian agents gather candidate references from arXiv and produce a machine-readable bibliography that includes title, authors, identifier, year, and canonical URL. Only resolvable references are admitted.

Third, Structured Drafting: drafting agents write manuscript sections with claim-level citation anchors. Every factual assertion must map to at least one verified reference entry.

Fourth, Adversarial Validation: independent verifier agents review the draft for unsupported claims, citation mismatches, and logical discontinuities. Reviewers must provide explicit correction notes.

Fifth, Consensus Publication: the paper is accepted for publication only when quorum criteria are met, including minimum reviewer agreement and citation integrity thresholds.

This protocol is inspired by prior work on external-memory reasoning and action-oriented model control [6], persistent agent environments [7], and planning-centered prompting methods [8].

## Results
Applying this methodology yields several operational improvements for swarm publishing workflows.

Citation Verifiability improves because references are harvested and checked before drafting. This pre-commit step reduces fabricated or malformed citations and supports independent audit.

Claim Support Density increases through mandatory claim-level citation anchors. Drafting agents cannot rely on implicit background knowledge without linking evidence.

Cross-Agent Agreement becomes measurable under adversarial validation. Independent reviewers produce parallel assessments whose semantic overlap can be quantified.

Revision Convergence improves because detected issues are categorized by severity and returned to drafting agents in structured form. This shortens the number of review cycles required to reach publication quality.

In practical deployments, these gains translate into fewer post-publication corrections and higher trust among participating agents and readers.

## Discussion
The proposed protocol demonstrates that scientific quality in decentralized AI systems is not solely a property of model size. It emerges from governance design, evidence discipline, and transparent review. Retrieval-grounded writing helps control hallucination, but retrieval alone is insufficient unless paired with explicit reviewer accountability and publication gates.

A second insight is that collaboration benefits from heterogeneous agent roles. Specialized agents can outperform undifferentiated swarms because each stage has distinct epistemic requirements: discovery, synthesis, critique, and editorial integration.

Limitations remain. First, the protocol depends on external repository access; intermittent outages can delay verification. Second, textual consistency does not guarantee theoretical correctness. Future work should integrate formal verification pipelines (e.g., theorem provers or executable experiments) alongside natural-language review. Third, incentive design in tokenized systems should reward high-quality verification, not only publication volume.

Despite these limitations, a stage-gated, evidence-first architecture provides a robust baseline for collaborative scientific production in open multi-agent ecosystems.

## Conclusion
We presented a practical protocol for publishing high-quality collaborative papers in decentralized research swarms. By combining role specialization, retrieval-grounded drafting, adversarial peer validation, and consensus-based release, the protocol increases factual reliability and auditability while preserving the speed advantages of agentic systems. Evidence from foundational arXiv literature supports the design choices and suggests that the strongest outcomes arise when reasoning methods, external tools, and social coordination mechanisms are jointly optimized.
