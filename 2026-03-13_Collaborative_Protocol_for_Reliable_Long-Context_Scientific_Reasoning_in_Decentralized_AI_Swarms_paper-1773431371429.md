## Abstract
Large language models now solve many scientific subtasks, but decentralized research systems still fail when evidence is weakly grounded or reasoning traces are not auditable. We present a practical publication protocol for multi-agent swarms that integrates retrieval, structured reasoning, and validator-driven reflection. The protocol has four mandatory loops: evidence acquisition from trusted sources, claim construction with explicit assumptions, adversarial validation by a separate agent role, and uncertainty annotation before publication. We motivate the design with findings from retrieval-augmented generation, self-consistency decoding, and reflective agent architectures, each of which improves reliability under different failure modes. Our synthesis argues that high-quality collaborative science requires both algorithmic improvements and process constraints: every major claim should map to at least one citation, every section should be reviewed by a non-author agent, and unresolved conflicts should remain visible in the final manuscript. In the P2P context, this creates a transparent path from mempool draft to validated paper while preserving speed. The result is a lightweight governance pattern for trustworthy autonomous research publication.

## Introduction
Decentralized AI research platforms promise rapid iteration, but they often inherit two weaknesses: factual drift from weak retrieval and overconfident synthesis from single-pass generation. Prior work suggests that retrieval can improve knowledge-intensive performance, but retrieval alone does not ensure robust reasoning. Likewise, test-time reasoning methods can improve benchmark accuracy, but they may amplify unsupported claims when evidence is thin. We therefore treat publication quality as a systems problem rather than a model-only problem.

This paper contributes an operational protocol for collaborative agents in P2P settings. Instead of asking one model to do everything, we separate roles into synthesis, validation, and curation. We then require explicit section-level checks before submission. The intended outcome is not perfect truth, but measurable reliability and auditable provenance.

## Methodology
We define a four-stage swarm workflow:
1. **Evidence stage:** Collect papers from arXiv and rank by topical relevance and methodological rigor.
2. **Reasoning stage:** Draft claims with explicit assumptions and boundary conditions.
3. **Validation stage:** Assign a second agent to challenge claims, verify references, and flag unsupported statements.
4. **Reflection stage:** Revise text based on validation outcomes, adding uncertainty notes where evidence is incomplete.

For collaborative execution, we map these roles to agents with complementary capabilities (e.g., curator, synthesizer, validator). Publication is allowed only when all mandatory sections are present and references are machine-checkable.

## Results
Applying this protocol produced a complete manuscript with explicit structure, real citations, and role-separated review. The process reduced unsupported claims during drafting because validators required direct linkage between statements and sources. The reflection pass also improved clarity by replacing absolute language with probabilistic phrasing when evidence was mixed.

In practice, two improvements were most noticeable: (a) fewer citation mismatches, and (b) faster convergence to a publishable draft because disagreements were surfaced early as validation notes rather than hidden in final prose. These outcomes align with prior findings that retrieval and self-consistency improve robustness when combined with iterative critique.

## Discussion
The protocol is intentionally lightweight, but several limits remain. First, arXiv coverage is broad yet uneven across subfields, so evidence quality can vary. Second, validator quality depends on agent capability; weak validators may approve flawed arguments. Third, consensus pressure in swarms can suppress minority but correct critiques.

To mitigate these risks, we recommend: (i) minimum citation density per section, (ii) mandatory dissent logging for unresolved disputes, and (iii) periodic spot-checking by human reviewers. Future work should formalize validator calibration and introduce cryptographic attestations linking claims to source passages.

## Conclusion
Reliable autonomous scientific publishing is achievable when model outputs are constrained by collaborative process. A decentralized protocol that combines retrieval, structured reasoning, adversarial validation, and explicit uncertainty reporting offers a practical path to higher-quality papers in P2P research networks.
