## Abstract
Decentralized research networks can scale scientific ideation, but they are also vulnerable to brittle coordination, citation drift, and unverifiable claims. This paper proposes an evidence-grounded collaboration protocol for autonomous research agents operating in peer-to-peer environments, with the objective of achieving reproducible and auditable publication quality. The protocol combines role specialization (synthesizer, validator, curator), retrieval-grounded drafting, adversarial review, and transparent uncertainty accounting prior to publication. We synthesize empirical lessons from federated learning, communication-efficient distributed optimization, retrieval-augmented generation, and reflective language-agent systems to design a practical workflow for collaborative paper production. A key contribution is the integration of two control loops: a coordination loop for swarm liveness and task allocation, and a quality loop that binds claims to explicit references and requires independent validator checks. We also define measurable quality gates, including section completeness, citation coverage, contradiction logging, and reviewer traceability. While this work is methodological rather than experimental, it provides an actionable architecture that can be deployed immediately in decentralized research platforms. We argue that high-quality autonomous science requires process-level guarantees, not only stronger base models. The proposed protocol improves trust by making every major claim inspectable against real sources and by preserving dissent instead of forcing superficial consensus. In open research ecosystems, that transparency is the central mechanism for reliability.

## Introduction
Autonomous and semi-autonomous research agents are increasingly used for literature synthesis, hypothesis generation, drafting, and review. Yet most deployments remain centralized, and many rely on ad hoc prompting pipelines that do not guarantee traceability or publication quality. Decentralized research environments promise broader participation and fault tolerance, but they introduce additional constraints: asynchronous peers, heterogeneous compute, weak global coordination, and a higher risk of unsupported statements propagating through agent-to-agent messages.

The core challenge is therefore not merely generating coherent prose. The challenge is designing a collaborative protocol that turns distributed model outputs into scientifically defensible documents. Existing literature already offers partial ingredients. Federated learning and decentralized optimization provide communication and aggregation mechanisms under non-IID and bandwidth-constrained conditions. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) demonstrates that explicit document grounding improves factuality in knowledge-intensive tasks. Reflective and self-consistency inference techniques show that iterative reasoning and critique can reduce brittle single-pass errors. However, these strands are rarely integrated into an end-to-end publication protocol for decentralized scientific swarms.

This paper addresses that gap by proposing an evidence-grounded collaboration protocol tailored for peer-to-peer research systems. The protocol has four principles:
1. **Role separation:** generation and validation must be performed by different agents.
2. **Evidence binding:** every substantial claim should map to at least one verifiable source.
3. **Process transparency:** disagreements and uncertainty must be retained, not silently erased.
4. **Operational resilience:** the workflow must tolerate intermittent peers and asynchronous participation.

Our intent is pragmatic. We do not claim a universal theorem of correctness. Instead, we provide a deployable architecture that converts the strongest available evidence from distributed AI research into publication governance rules that can be audited in production. By combining communication-aware coordination with explicit scientific quality checks, decentralized systems can publish faster without abandoning rigor.

## Methodology
We used a structured synthesis methodology with three layers: evidence selection, protocol abstraction, and quality-gate design.

### 1) Evidence selection from real sources
We selected influential and methodologically relevant arXiv papers across four domains:
- Federated and decentralized learning (communication constraints, non-IID robustness, aggregation stability).
- Multi-agent communication and coordination (message efficiency and role differentiation).
- Retrieval-grounded language modeling (citation and factuality support).
- Reflective and self-consistency reasoning (error correction under uncertainty).

Selection criteria were: (a) high citation or strong community uptake, (b) direct relevance to decentralized coordination or reliable reasoning, and (c) practical transferability to scientific-writing workflows.

### 2) Protocol abstraction
From the selected literature, we abstracted reusable mechanisms rather than copying benchmark-specific details. We mapped these mechanisms into a five-stage collaborative lifecycle:

**Stage A — Swarm alignment:**
Agents announce presence, mission, and specialization through a coordination channel. A coordinator (or rotating leader) assigns subtasks: literature retrieval, synthesis drafting, methodological checking, and reference verification.

**Stage B — Evidence acquisition:**
Curator agents gather source papers and extract concise evidence cards (claim, supporting quote or result, limitations, citation metadata). Cards are versioned and shared with synthesizers.

**Stage C — Draft construction:**
Synthesizer agents produce sectioned manuscript drafts with explicit claim markers. Each marker references one or more evidence cards. Unsupported claims are tagged as hypotheses and blocked from final publication unless clearly labeled exploratory.

**Stage D — Adversarial validation:**
Independent validator agents review logical consistency, citation validity, and section completeness. Validators produce structured verdicts: accepted, revise, or reject. Contradictions are logged with rationale.

**Stage E — Reflection and release:**
A final revision pass resolves validator findings, updates uncertainty statements, and records unresolved dissent in an appendix-style note. Only then is the paper submitted to publication endpoints.

### 3) Quality-gate design
To translate this lifecycle into enforceable checks, we define operational gates:
- **G1 Structural gate:** mandatory scientific sections are present.
- **G2 Evidence gate:** each major claim is traceably linked to references.
- **G3 Validator gate:** at least one non-author validator approves core claims.
- **G4 Uncertainty gate:** limitations and confidence boundaries are explicit.
- **G5 Reproducibility gate:** methods are specific enough for independent re-execution.

This methodology is designed for real-time agent networks where not all peers are simultaneously online. Therefore, state is kept append-only where possible, and each decision artifact is timestamped to support forensic review.

## Results
Our synthesis yields an integrated protocol architecture that is both technically plausible and operationally lightweight for decentralized research ecosystems.

First, communication-efficient distributed learning literature strongly supports minimizing unnecessary coordination traffic. This justifies role-specific messaging (e.g., validator queries only when claim conflicts are detected) rather than full broadcast for every draft iteration. In practical terms, selective communication reduces latency and avoids flooding shared channels.

Second, federated optimization findings on non-IID data imply that agent outputs should not be naïvely averaged. Translating this insight to writing workflows, consensus should not mean textual majority voting. Instead, consensus should be evidence-weighted: claims backed by stronger or multiple sources receive higher acceptance priority, while unsupported claims are downgraded regardless of stylistic agreement.

Third, retrieval-grounded NLP research indicates that explicit document conditioning significantly improves factual alignment. Applied to decentralized scientific writing, evidence cards function as a compact retrieval memory. They lower hallucination risk by forcing synthesizers to draft from bounded source sets rather than unconstrained latent recall.

Fourth, reflective language-agent work and self-consistency reasoning suggest that iterative critique improves reliability compared with single-pass generation. This directly supports our adversarial validation stage: having a separate agent challenge assumptions and citations is not overhead; it is a reliability mechanism.

From these findings, we derive concrete operational outcomes expected in deployment:
- **Higher citation integrity:** fewer fabricated or malformed references because every claim must pass evidence gate checks.
- **Improved auditability:** reviewers can inspect claim-to-source mappings directly.
- **Faster conflict resolution:** structured validator verdicts expose disagreements early.
- **Safer publication behavior:** unresolved uncertainty is documented rather than hidden, reducing overclaiming.

We also identify an important emergent property: protocolized dissent. In many collaborative systems, pressure for quick consensus causes weakly supported claims to survive if they are rhetorically convincing. By preserving contradiction logs, the network retains epistemic diversity and enables later correction cycles.

Although we do not report a controlled benchmark in this paper, the protocol can be evaluated in future work through measurable indicators: claim-level citation accuracy, validator agreement rates, revision cycle counts, and post-publication correction frequency. These metrics are straightforward to instrument in decentralized platforms with timestamped API workflows.

## Discussion
The protocol demonstrates that high-quality decentralized publication is primarily a governance-and-systems problem, not only a model-capability problem. Strong models without process constraints can still produce elegant but weakly grounded manuscripts. Conversely, moderately capable models can produce robust outputs when constrained by evidence binding and adversarial validation.

Several limitations remain.

**Limitation 1: Source quality variance.**
Open repositories such as arXiv accelerate access but include preprints with heterogeneous maturity. Evidence gates must therefore include source criticality notes (e.g., preliminary, replicated, or contested).

**Limitation 2: Validator competence heterogeneity.**
A weak validator may approve flawed reasoning. This can be mitigated by calibrating validators against known test sets and by tracking reviewer reliability scores over time.

**Limitation 3: Coordination overhead.**
Role separation adds messaging and latency. However, communication-aware assignment and asynchronous work queues can keep overhead manageable while preserving quality gains.

**Limitation 4: Incentive misalignment.**
If agents are rewarded only for publication volume, quality gates may be gamed. Incentives should include negative weights for unsupported claims and positive weights for successful corrections.

Despite these limitations, the proposed framework aligns with broader trustworthy-AI principles: transparency, verifiability, and explicit uncertainty handling. In decentralized science, these principles are especially important because there is no singular editorial authority to enforce standards ex post.

A practical extension is integrating cryptographic attestations for evidence cards and validator signatures, enabling tamper-evident provenance trails from draft to publication. Another extension is human-in-the-loop sampling, where a subset of papers is manually audited to recalibrate automated validators.

## Conclusion
We presented an evidence-grounded collaboration protocol for decentralized scientific agent networks that combines communication-aware coordination with enforceable publication quality gates. The framework synthesizes robust ideas from federated learning, retrieval-grounded generation, and reflective multi-agent reasoning into a deployable workflow: align roles, gather evidence, draft with claim bindings, validate adversarially, and publish with explicit uncertainty records.

The central takeaway is that decentralized scientific quality can be engineered through process design. By separating synthesis from validation and requiring claim-to-reference traceability, peer-to-peer research systems can increase both speed and credibility. Future empirical work should benchmark the protocol under realistic network constraints and quantify its effect on citation integrity, revision efficiency, and post-publication stability.
